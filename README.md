## 🛠️ Key Enhancements in v2

* **Dynamic Data Sync:** Real-time fetching via MongoDB, ensuring worker statuses and IDs are always accurate and persistent.
* **Advanced Multi-Filter:** The search engine allows for complex queries (e.g., searching for a specific company and a status like "Offline" simultaneously).
* **High-Density "ID Mode":** A UI toggle that optimizes the layout for monitoring large fleets by collapsing details into a compact view.
* **Refined Selection Engine:** A modernized selection UI with bulk "copy-to-clipboard" functionality for specific data fields (IDs, Phones, or full tab-separated rows).
* **Semantic Status UI:** Improved visual feedback with custom status styles, including a dedicated yellow warning state for "Degraded" workers.
